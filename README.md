# Kickstarting with Excel Analysis
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
### The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise start a crowdfunding campaign and help her fund her play "Fever". I assisted Louise by analyzing crowdfunding data to determine specific factors that'll help provide insignt for Louise's campaign to be successful. By analyzing the data, I can get a better understanding of campaigns from start to finish to help Louise plan and set up their campaign for success. 

##Analysis and Challenges
###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- One way to determine how successful campaigns are, are to look at the outcome of campaigns based on their launch date. It's important to understand when campaigns were the most successful as well as when the most campaigns failed. Understanding when campaigns were the most successful, will show us when individuals were most active in theater and plays. This will help us determine roughly when the best time is to potentially launch a campaign. 

###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Another way to determine how successful campaigns are, are to look at the percentage of the outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled) of campaigns based on their funding goals. So understanding the percent of campaigns that were successful, failed, and were canceled based on their funding goal amount. This information provides us with the knowledge of understading whether a campaign had to high or to low of a funding goal, for example, and how it was a factor in whether or not it was successful, failed, or lead to it being canceled. This was important to understand what range Louise needed to be within for their campaign goal for it to be successful. 

###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- One challenge of this dataset is that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. To assist Louise in creating a successful campaign, it was challenging and difficult to figure out what variables were the strongest to look at to assist with the outcome we were looking for. A difficulty encountered was where Louise was looking at plays between the US and Great Britian for their play "Fever". The overall outcome is based on the US, however, having that interest in campaigning potentially in Great Britain, the results will not be the same. Therefore, generating the pivot tables was definitely helpful in being able to filter the data between the two countries. A campaign could be successful in one country, but fail in another country. 
- Therefore, another challange is being able to understand the sample we are looking at in the dataset. Since Louise wanted to put their play on in the US, it was challenging to make sure when analyizing the data that everything was within the US. The dataset contained information from multiple countries, so it was important to make sure everything was filtered correctly when extracting data and creating/filtering pivot tables for the results. If information was not filtered correctly, then the results would be skewed. 

##Results
- There are two conclusion you can draw from the outcomes based on launch date. First, based on the 'Theater Outcomes by Launch Date' graph, you can see that the campaigns launched during the months of May and June were the most successful. However, the month of May also had the highest amount of failed campaigns. The months of July and October also showed a high amount of failed campaigns. Therefore, the best time for Louis to campaign would be somewhere between the months of May and June, but closer to the month of June since May also had a high amount of failed campaigns.
- The second conclusion you can gather from the graph is that overall, more campaigns succeeded rather than failed, with an average of around 29 campaigns being more successful a month. However, in the month of December about the same amount of campgains succeeded and failed, with successful campaigns being slightly higher than failed. December would be the worst time of the year for Louis to campaign. If you remove Decemeber from the average, then around 31 campaigns were more successful compared to failed per month.

- By looking at the 'Outcomes vs Goals' graph, you can see that the most successful campaigns, were those who had a funding goal of around $4,999 or less, with the most successfull having a funding goal of $1,000 or less. Campaigns that also had a goal around $35,000 to $44,999 were also successful with around 67% successful. However, campaigns with a funding goal of $45,000 to $49,999 all failed. In addition, campaigns that had funding goals around $25,000 to $34,000, had high failure percentages ranging from 73% to 80% failed. For Louise's campaign to be successful, they should keep their goal around $4,999 or less. Even though campaigns with a funding goal around $35,000 to $49,000 were also successful, the funding goals in between $4,9999 to $35,000 failed. Therefore, if Louise makes their funding goal to large to where they don't meet their goal, it's possible their campaign will fail. Keeping Louise's goal around $4,999 or less provides a more attainable goal for success.

- There are some of the limitations of this dataset. One limitation to this dataset is the sample size. Looking at the outcomes based on goals, the percentages of campaigns that were successful and failed continues to switch. By gathering more data, the more accurate the analyses will be in finding the percentages of those that were successful and failed based on funding goals. Gathering more data will also provide more accurate results for all variables that were collected. 
- Another limiation, is that when we ran the outcomes based on goals, there were no canceled plays. Being able to understand that data more, to be able to interpret why there were no canceled plays and how that impacts the data and results is important. For example, if a campaign was failing at reaching their goal, understaing why they continued instead of canceling, and how that impacts the overall results of the analysis.  
- There are some other possible tables and or graphs that we can look at as well to help Louise with a successful campaign. One possibility is looking at the duration of time between the launch date and end date, to see if those that had a longer duration of time were more successful compared to those with a shorter duration of time. Another possibility would be to look at the percentage funded. By seeing the fund percent of the campaigns, we can potential understand and see if those that were funded more have higher successful campaigns compared to those that had a lower funding percent.
